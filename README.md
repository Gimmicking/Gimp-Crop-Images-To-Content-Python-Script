This script will crop a specified number of images that are opened in a Gimp section to the content and override the original image with this cropped image
You must have Python and pyautogui installed for this script to work. 

Tested to work with...
* Python 3.8.10
* pyautogui 0.9.54 (installable with "pip install pyautogui" on Windows CLI)
* Gimp version 2.10.38

To specify how many images you want to modify, just open the .py file in any text editor and make the variable "numberofimages" equal the number of images you would like to have cropped to content and exported over the original file.
